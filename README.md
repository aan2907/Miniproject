# Automatic Number Plate Recognition System using YOLO and PaddleOCR

This repository contains an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system implemented in Python using YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection and PaddleOCR for text recognition. The system is capable of detecting and recognizing license plates from images or video streams.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- OpenCV (>= 4.0)
- numpy (>= 1.18)
- paddlepaddle (>= 2.1.0)
- paddleocr (>= 2.3.0)
- torch (>= 1.9.0)
- torchvision (>= 0.10.0)
- tqdm (>= 4.62.3)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/automatic-number-plate-recognition.git

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd automatic-number-plate-recognition

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
